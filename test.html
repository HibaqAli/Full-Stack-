     <p> Each day, your heart beats around 100,000 times. <br>  This continuously pumps about five litres (eight pints) of blood around your body through a network of blood vessels called your circulatory system.  <br> This blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to all parts of your body to help your organs and muscles work properly. <br> Your blood also carries away unwanted carbon dioxide and waste products.</p>
